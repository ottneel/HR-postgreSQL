--1. Find the longest ongoing project for each department.
SELECT

	MAX(end_date) as longest_ongoing_project
FROM projects AS p
inner join departments d
on p.department_id = d.id
where end_date>= CURRENT_DATE
group by department_name


--2. Find all employees who are not managers.
select

	e.job_title
from employees as e
where job_title NOT LIKE '%Manager';


--3. Find all employees who have been hired after the start of a project in their department.
select

inner join projects p on p.department_id= d.id
where e.hire_date > p.start_date
GROUP BY d.name, e.name, e.hire_date,p.start_date

--4. Rank employees within each department based on their hire date (earliest hire gets the highest rank).
SELECT rank() over(partition by d.name order by e.hire_date asc) as rank_order,

	lead(hire_date) over(PARTITION by d.name order by hire_date asc) as next_employee_hire_date
